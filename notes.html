      <h3>My HTML notes<br> <sub>by Vernon</sub></h3>

          <p><em>Markup</em> is the <mark>tags</mark> and <mark>elements</mark> within HTML that help organize or alters the way the text is viewed in HTML without the use of CSS.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tags:</strong> are the specific markup chracters that we place before, after or wrap around our text to style or organize the text <br>
              -ex. &lt;p&gt;, &lt;/p&gt; ,&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; are tags that we wrap around text to organize it has a paragraph, or to place emphasis on text.

            <li><strong>Elements:</strong> are the entirity of the text with its opening and closing tag, or in the case of a optional closer tag, then just the opening tag and text.<br>
              -ex. &lt;p&gt; "I am a paragraph element" &lt;/p&gt; , &lt;em&gt; <em> I am a emphasis element </em> &lt;/em&gt;
          </ul>

        <p> As stated in the above notes some tags have optional closings, and i'll go over 2 of them and how they close themselves without a closing tag.

          <ol>
            <li> Paragraphs or &lt;p&gt; - is a tag that is kinda used to organize the sections of the HTML, like when you write out the paragraphs in an essay. To organize the text the browser sees the text that is in the paragraph
              tag as if it's inside of a box, with it's own height and width and creates space around that box(margins), the browser knows that the paragraph is down when it encounters the next "block" element, like a new paragraph,
               like in writing.
            <li> List or &lt;li&gt; - is a tag that is used organize text into list like i have done above with the bullects and here as well with the numbered items. This tag has an optional closer also since list can only work between
              the tags of &lt;ol&gt; ordered list and &lt;ul&gt; unordered list. So the browser know the list item has ended when you either start the next List tag or after you close the ordered or unordered lst.
          </ol>

      <p>I'm just going to add a bit of nesting and <a href="https://udacity.com/">links</a> into my code so:
        <ul>
          <li>Don't Mind
            <ol>
              <li>How</li>
              <li> Strange This</li>
            </ol>
          <li>May
          <li>Look.....
          <li> Oh shoot! a bear..
        </ul>
